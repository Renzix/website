    <h2 class="text-center">About Me</h2>
    <p class="text-default">Hello my name is Daniel DeBruno and i am a aspiring computer scientist. I pretty much obsess over every subject I can learn about.
     I learned about programing in Minecraft from a mod called Computer Craft which uses basic Lua scripting. After that I ended up learning Java trying
     to create a mod for Minecraft however never finishing it. A computer science club was hosted at my highschool and their I learned python. After highschool
     I learned about dual booting mainly because my Father got me a mac. Once I learned dual booting existed I quickly found out linux existed and spent 
     the majority of my college career learning more about linux. Writing this website so i can learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, PHP, Jquery and
     how to set up a Apache Server(Archlinux)</p>
