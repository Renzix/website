                <h2>Highschool</h2>
                <p>Hi my name is Daniel DeBruno. My interest in programming started in 10th grade 
                when playing a popular game called minecraft. I downloaded a mod called computercraft 
                which implements computers in minecraft and the computers are programable by means of
                the Lua programming language. I imediately fell in love with the possibility of
                doing things automatically with programs and from there i spent the whole summer
                learning java to make my own mod. I never ending up making it however i learned 
                alot. Senior year of highschool my school offered a computer science club. I quickily
                joined it and learned python and made a game of hangman using pygame.</p>
                <h2>CCM</h2>
                <p>After highschool I went to CCM(county college of morris) and learned what object
                oriented programming was(because my first language was lua i didnt understand it). I
                also found out what linux was and loved it. Previously I only used windows and the
                mac I got for christmas(around 11th grade). I went from ubuntu to linux mint to archlinux 
                and used arch with bspwm towards to end. I also set up my first and second web server 
                during this time(link on left panel). It used archlinux I think but I used php and
                apache and wanted to setup a server using Nginx without php.</p>
                <h2>WPU(current)</h2>
                <p>Switched from Archlinux to Gentoo on my main machine and stopped dualbooting 
                windows. Also I set up this webserver which runs fedora.</p>
