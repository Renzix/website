#My Website

Here is my website it is nothing special yet. I plan on making a simple http server in rust then redesigning this website to only use nodejs OR python depending on if i feel i should learn nodejs(i already know a decent amount of python).

It should be noted that most of my plans for the website are actually on the website itself. Also my website may be down as I run it on a home server using the latest version of Fedora.
