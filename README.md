## Website3

This is not my 3rd website but its the 3rd since I started counting/saving them. The goal of this website is to make it as clean as humanly possible. That means I am going to write my own http webserver using rust and use nodejs.

It should be noted that my first website was using php and only using includes. My second website was not saved and it only used js,css, and html with openbsd's http server. My 3rd website was made to learn some Fedora and use nextcloud which requires php. This is actually my 4th website and my goal in this one is to make it as bloat free as possible. That means i will write it in Rust and try to use as much raw html/css/js as possible.
